# Scatt
The official source code for the beloved Scatt Discord bot. If you want to meet the bot in person, you can [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/pMT68y6hVT)!
## About Scatt
Scatt is one of the most complex bots that we've seen, considering it's meant for just one server/community. It is a huge project, and Scatt is constantly being changed for new events, new features, and new updates. Some special Scatt features include:
- Modmail
- XP leaderboard
- Chat in channels via Scatt
- Warnings
- Suggestions
- Bug reports
- QOTD
- Connect other accounts (Scratch, wasteof, etc.)
- Verification
- Counting
- Much, Much More!
## Setting Up Your Own Scatt
You need to make sure that you create a secret called `DISCORD_TOKEN` and set it to your secret bot token for Discord. Other than that, you'll just have to change the channel ID's in `/dist/index.js`. That will make it specific to your server. Please make sure to credit ScratchTools for the original Scatt code.
